# Cloudflare DNS Purge Script

This script allows you to delete all DNS records for a specified domain on Cloudflare using the Cloudflare API.

## Prerequisites

- Bash (Linux/macOS) or similar terminal environment
- jq (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor)
- [Cloudflare API Token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api)
- Cloudflare Zone ID

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the script to your local environment.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloudflare-dns-purge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the script directory.

   ```bash
   cd cloudflare-dns-purge
   ```

3. Open the script in a text editor and replace the placeholder values with your Cloudflare API token and Zone ID.

   ```bash
   API_TOKEN="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
   ZONE_ID="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID"
   ```

4. Save the changes and make the script executable.

   ```bash
   chmod +x cloudflare_dns_purge.sh
   ```

5. Run the script.
